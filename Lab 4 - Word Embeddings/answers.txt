Q1:

It Describes the number of unique words that we have in our vocabulary and each one of them has its own embedding vector that describes its meaning


Q2:

this describes the length of the vector that describes the word spain and each other word
as each of them is described by a vector with length 300 contains the semantics of this word


Predicted Country:
Egypt

Predicted Similarity:
0.7626820802688599

Q3:

yes it is the correct one as Athens is the capital of Greece so using the same relation we can know that cairo is the capital of egypt


Q4:

yes it makes sense as
country1 - capital1  = country2 - capital2
then to get the embedding of country2 we will get capital2 on the other side then this would be a valid estimation for the embedding value of the correct one
and egypt is the most similar answer to this one
so Cairo to Egypt has the same relation as Athens to Greece

Q5:

Yes it makes sense, 
as we can see that each cluster is containing data that are related to each other 
and when the meaning of them is so close they are so close also


Q6:

Here we can see like 3 clusters
as each of them has related data as those words appear in similar context
we can also split them into 4 clusters
as
1-> gas oil petroleum  (somethings related to each other in context  to each other so they are close to each other)
2-> country continent  (continent consists of many countries so they are related to each other in context and they are close)
3-> city town village  (they are also related to each other in context to each other as we can say they have the same relation as a place people live in)
4-> happy joyful sad   (They are adjectives that can describe the human mood as if the human is happy or sad or joyful so they are related to each other in context)
Taking a side note that it doesn't take care of the meaning of the word as happy and sad are closer to each other but it takes consideration of the context they were mentioned in
